# Notes

* Is Azure well set-up for dev/test scenarios on new apps (especially those being built on open source technology)
* OSS experience on Azure compared to AWS
* Visual studio experience on Azure compared to AWS
* What we are missing in visual studio to use as a true cross platform application (compared to our competitive set)? 
* Is open source more easily connected to AWS?
* Seems to be a tendency for dev/test to focus on sustaining existing applications vs. focusing on new apps 
* What kind of OSS applications are being built today (Apache Casandra, Data Stacks, Open Stack, NoSQL) â€“ what are the 1-3 Open Source scenarios happening on the Enterprise side.

# AWS

## Get tools
* Install Python2.7 and the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Cli tools (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)

## Get credentials
* Sign into AWS and navigate to the EC2 service
* Click on the link to key pairs
* Create a new key pair
* Click on your username in the top right of the website and select "Security Credentials"
* Create a new access key (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)
* Save the generated credentials somewhere sercure.

## Deploy app 
* Open a command prompt in your project directory
* if you do not have a git repo create one, add the files and commit.
** The ElasticBeanstalk tools will hook into your git branch and deploy the latest commit **
* enter the command

> eb init  

* You will then be prompted for a environment name and  and the Elastic Beanstalk instance that the deployment will generate, the key pair to use and the type of deployment (NodeJS)
* You will also be prompted for the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key generated earlier
* enter the command

> eb create


## Install mongoDB on the EC2 instance
* Install Putty tools (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
* Open PuttyGen.
* Click on load and select the downloaded private key from the key pair you generated
* Save the private key in the .ppk format so putty can read it
* Open the AWS portal and navigate to the EC2 service
** Elastic Beanstalk automates the process of deploying web applications to EC2 Instances, You could alternativly spin up a EC2 instance and deploy yourself but it would require installing all dependancies manually **
* Select your newly deployed instance and get the Public DNS

# Azure

## Create Azure Website and database
* Login to the Azure
* Create a resource group
* Create a web app in the resource group
* create a documentDb instance in the resource group
* Navigate to the webapp and select the continous deployment option 
* Choose source of local Git Repository
* Navigate to the properties and select the Git Url
* Open a command prompt in you project directory
* If you do not have a git repo create one, add the files and commit.
* Run the following commands

> git remote add azure `<Your Git Url>`   
> git push azure
